*****************************
What do you mean by Overtime Policy?@
When the employees work above the scheduled working hours allotted to them
and get minimum wages, it becomes essential to pay them for the overtime
work done as per the pro-rate basis. The conﬁguration and designing of
attributes like how much amount to be paid, how much maximum overtime
hours to be counted, compensation against worked overtime, etc. build up the
overtime policy. This policy is designed to ensure that employees beneﬁt from
working overtime as per the government declared laws. This law also states
punishment to be charged against employers not adhering to the law. Our
overtime policy template will provide sample policy and insights about what key
components to be kept in mind when designing the policy.
*****************************
What do you mean by Overtime Policy?@
This sample policy will help you know
● It ensures that the employees are compensated impartially for the additional hours worked.
● Such additional time is considered as overtime only when the employee has received the permission for the same from the employer/superior.
● The overtime is granted keeping in mind the goals of the employee and their need. This may vary from case to case.
● The company can also provide mandatory overtime which means the employee
has to work extra for the allotted hours. Failure to do so without prior notice can
lead to severe consequences.
● An overtime cap or limit needs to be set by the company.
● Overtime hours should be recorded precisely and the payment should be calculated accurately.
*****************************

Overtime Policy_page_2
#######
*****************************
Overtime Policy Template Sample@
“Coral AI’s” Overtime Policy aims at reducing labor expenses for employees
who spend extra hours to meet deadlines by oﬀering them respective monetary
beneﬁts. In necessity, employees are required to work more time to ensure that
the essential projects are ﬁnished on time.
As a business, we commit to compensating extra eﬀorts and time given by our
subordinates with fair pay rates.
*****************************
Purpose@
This policy is required to gather details of remuneration for more time put into
work. This ensures that an employee is regularly and correctly paid for their
excess time.
It helps to tackle misuse of working extra, decreased productivity, and ill
employee health.
It is designed considering critical factors such as days and departments to be
excluded from the beneﬁts.
For example, holidays or sick leave are not considered oﬃcial hours. Employees
and consultants on probation are not eligible and hence can be excluded from
these beneﬁts.
*****************************
Scope@
This policy is usually applied to all the conﬁrmed employees of the organization.
Overtime remuneration is met if an employee works higher than the hours
prescribed by company norms. i.e., hours spent beyond the workweek.
*****************************


#############################
Overtime Policy_page_3
#######
*****************************
Scope@
An employee is expected to receive permission from a supervisor to be eligible
for payment.
Overtime can not be compensated as extra hours are put in without prior
agreement. Factors such as coming early, staying late, or working during breaks
are not deemed as working extra.
*****************************
Overtime approval@
Employees must take their supervisors’ approval before applying for overtime.
However, it is only allowed when an employee is uncertain about completing
their allotted tasks.
*****************************
Mandatory overtime@
Often an organization may require their employees to work extra due to peak
hours. Working extra hours is seen as a requirement when the need arises.
Declining the proposal after the fair notice can trigger disciplinary actions such
as termination or elongation of probation.
*****************************
Limitations to overtime@
A few limitations to consider while considering extra working are:
● Employees should always try to complete a given task within regular working
hours.
● Overtime should only be used under emergencies or urgent situations where work
exceeds regular official hours; hence, the tasks given are generally designed to
keep a standard workweek in mind.
● Employees are not encouraged to view the availability of working extra as extra
income, meaning it should be looked at as a last alternative for the overload of
work and tight deadlines, etc.
*****************************


#############################
Overtime Policy_page_4
#######
*****************************
Healthy overtime arrangements@
After-hours working is not a promotable option. Safety measures around the
use of overtime are necessary as no organization would like loss of morale and
productivity or other overwork accidents.
● Accurate logs of overtime worked must be recorded and maintained.
● Strongly advise the employees to view this option as a last resort in times of
emergency.
● It is mandatory to offer the provisions to complete work during office hours.
● In case of observing low productivity or problems concerning increased office
hours, it is suggested to decrease this facility.
● A limit should be kept in place to promote a proper work-life balance and an
if an employee exceeds the employee’s mental health concerns. However,
specified overtime cap, then that will be paid considering legal rules.
*****************************
Consequences of unauthorized overtime@
Employees found violating overtime guidelines such as unapproved hours or
slacking productivity during standard company hours purposefully to avail
beneﬁts can face the consequences. It can be prolonged probation or even
termination, whichever suits the oﬀense.
*****************************
Procedure@
Both employer and employee must save accurate records to ensure overtime
pay. In addition, there are speciﬁc protocols to follow for a smooth process,
such as:
● The manager and their team must come to an agreement on time restrictions. The
manager must also guarantee that the agreed-upon limit does not conflict with
legal limits and that the employees do not work excessively long hours.
● The manager has to make employees aware of their eligibility. They are also
required to know details regarding benefits, processes, limits, credits, etc.
● Precise recording of overtime is necessary from both the manager’s end and the
employee’s end; this is then reviewed by the HR team.
● HR has to calculate the employee’s pay in accordance with legal overtime pay
rates and deploy the same with the next scheduled payday.

policy explains the process of payment to the employees as it envelopes the
administration of the salaries, time-sheet keeping, wage methods, and payment
schedules of an organization’s employees. This policy is deﬁned to place control
and make employees conscious of what they should anticipate on pay-day. Any
payroll policy should specify the responsibilities and accountabilities of staﬀ
managing the same. Since payroll covers sensitive and conﬁdential information,
the policy should also deﬁne access and safety levels. The policy should
diﬀerentiate the preparation required by various employee groups. To

What is Probation Policy?@
Appointing a recruit as a permanent employee from day one of joining the
organization may not be fruitful. In some instances, even after acing the
interviews, the employee–organization relationship may not work out. This can
happen due to several reasons: one of them being the lack of compatibility
between the organization and the recruit. To avoid such a short-lived
employment relationship, the organization implements a Probation Policy,
which is essentially a trial period between the recruit’s date of joining the
organization until he is given a permanent employee status.
*****************************
What is Probation Policy?@
This allows both employer and the organization to know each other better and
decide whether this is the right partnership. Apart from this, the employee can
use this time to discover if he is comfortable with the organization’s working
environment and job responsibilities. If the organization feels that the employee
is suitable for the organization and its working environment, the employee is
appointed as a permanent employee. In the opposite circumstances, the
employment is terminated.

*****************************
What is the Sick Leave Policy?@
Sick leaves are used by employees when they cannot come to work due to their
illness or any relatives’. Sick leave policy is a sample that states how much leaves
employees can take, what the frequency to avail is, etc. Mostly the number of
such leaves is ﬁxed by the organization under the adherence of legislature laws.
Pending Sick leaves can be encashed or carried forwarded as per the wish of the
employer. It must be ensured that employees don’t feel any pressure of work
during a particular time. The policy must provide a healthy kick-start with
motivation to the next working day.
*****************************
What is the Sick Leave Policy?@
In This Policy, You Will Get:
● The main purpose of the policy is to motivate the employee to get well soon and
return to the company with the same productivity which he served before falling ill.
● If the employee is disabled, he may be entitled for extended leave which would be
granted on a case to case basis by the management.
● If the employee is hospitalised for more than 24 hours, or disabled, he is entitled to
submit a certificate of fitness to resume his duties.
● According to the new deﬁnition of the sick leave, taking care of an ill family
member is also considered an eligible reason for applying for sick leave.
● In case of unused sick leaves, the employees are allowed to carry forward the
same up to a certain period of time.
● This feature also helps the employee to refrain from abusing the benefits of sick
leaves.
*****************************
Sick Leave Policy Sample@
Traditionally, sick leave is deﬁned as paid time oﬀ for an employee in the case of
illness or need of medical attention. And though this is a law in some regions,
there are a lot more places that are yet to pass a law regarding a paid sick leave
policy.
However, most organizations tend to oﬀer sick leave to their employees, paid or
otherwise, and tend to have some form of a sick leave policy in place. Ideally,
these policies require a sound design and proper planning, which is not the
norm everywhere.
*****************************


#############################
Sick Leave Policy_page_2
#######
*****************************
Purpose & Scope@
Every organization allows a certain number of days of sick leave to each
employee beginning on 1st January every year.
Some factors to consider are the work culture at the company, the company’s
policy regarding leaves, the eﬀect of the job on the employee’s well-being, etc.
The sick leave policy is an organization’s guidelines for when an employee falls
sick and cannot attend work on a particular day(s). Staying home in such a
situation is ideal from both the individual’s point of view as well as the
company’s point of view.
From the individual’s perspective, the added stress of travel and work could
hamper their road to recovery, adversely aﬀecting their productivity in the short
term.
As far as the organization is concerned, the concerned employee staying at
home improves his rate of recovery, which could reduce the number of overall
sick days availed by the employee. This also ensures that the employee does not
spread the disease to his/her colleagues, thereby maintaining overall
productivity.
In cases of mild sickness, the employee could avail the option of
work-from-home if applicable, which is a good middle-ground for all parties
concerned.
*****************************
Employees with disabilities@
Disabled employees, whether temporary or permanent, must be eligible for
extended leave. However, in most organisations, the requests for extended
leave are handled case-by-case. These requests are usually subject to the
discretion of the manager/team leader/supervisor/HR. In the event of hospitalisation of an employee for 24 hours or more, the employee, disabled or
otherwise, could be asked for a ﬁtness certiﬁcate to resume his duties.
*****************************


#############################
Sick Leave Policy_page_3
#######
*****************************
Procedure@
Though, as mentioned earlier, the traditional deﬁnition of sick leave is the time
oﬀ for an employee in case of an illness or in need of medical attention, this
deﬁnition has changed over time. Now, sick leave can typically be availed under
the following circumstances:
● Recovery from an existing illness.
● Resurrection from an accident.
● Health check-ups in case of sicknesses.
● To care for an ill family member.
*****************************
Procedure@
The employees should obey the following criteria.
If an employee chooses to avail his/her sick leave, they are expected to inform
their supervisor or HR or any relevant higher position at least half an hour
before their scheduled starting time.
They may also be required to produce a physician’s certiﬁcate if the HR or
manager deems it necessary.
However, the above-mentioned supervisor or HR reserves the right to deny sick
leaves if and when they deem necessary.
In case an employee exhausts all of his/her sick leave, he/she may use his/her
vacation leave as sick leave. However, sick leaves can never be treated as
vacation leaves.
*****************************
Accumulated sick leaves@
Employees are allowed to carry forward a speciﬁed number of sick leaves to use
for up to a speciﬁed number of years as deemed reasonable by the
management of the organisation. However, in case an employee is terminated or chooses to discontinue, they cannot encash the accumulated sick leaves as
they are not a part of compensation but rather a perk.
*****************************


#############################
Sick Leave Policy_page_4
#######
*****************************
Preventing the abuse of sick leave@
Additional perks could be provided to reduce sick leave abuse and reduce the
number of leaves. This could come in many forms.
For example:
● A percentage of unused sick leaves could be carried forward, which can then be available later.
● Another example of this would be a case where an employee who avails less than a predetermined number of days is eligible for a bonus or reward.

faced unjust discrimination in the workplace and are willing to take steps against
the same. These employees need to be protected to encourage other
employees to feel free to bring forward such issues.
*****************************

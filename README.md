It serves as a comprehensive solution for handling a variety of tasks related to rules, policies, and internal processes.<br>
Coral operates primarily as a chatbot, providing employees with a user-friendly interface to ask questions and seek information. This interface can be integrated into existing communication platforms or have a dedicated application. It can continuously learn and adapt to<br> changes in organizational rules and processes, enduring that it remains accurate and up-to-date. It can handle a wide range of internal inquiries, from HR-related questions (e.g., vacation policies, benefits) to IT support (e.g., troubleshooting common issues,<br> software installations).<br>
With coral, employees can get precise answers on demand without having to navigate complex. Coral has consistency and accuracy in providing information, reducing the risk of human error and interpretation discrepancies. <br>
Overall, Coral serves as a centralized, intelligent, and dynamic resource for employees, contributing to a more efficient and informedÂ workplace.<br>
